In this game, two players engage in a friendly competition. At the beginning, each player starts with a score of 0. The objective is to be the first to reach 100 points. However, there's a catch: if a player rolls a 1 on the dice before choosing to hold their score, they lose all their points accumulated during that turn, and the turn passes to the other player. On the other hand, if a player decides to hold their current score, they keep those points and the turn shifts to the other player. The game continues in this manner until one player successfully reaches the 100-point mark, declaring them the winner of the game. It's a blend of strategy, luck, and nerve as players weigh the risk of rolling again against the reward of potentially scoring big points.
